# string-similarity
In this repo I have worked on string similarity algorithms 

Algorithms which I have used are :

&bull; Hamming Distance
&bull; Levenshtein Distance
&bull; Damerau-levenshtein 
&bull; Jaro Distance
&bull; Jaro-Winkler
&bull; Jaccard Distance
&bull; Ngram Distance
&bull; Cosine Similarity Distance
&bull; Match Rating Comparsion

I compared this string - "There are many algorithms for checking string simlarity" with:

1 - "There are many algorithms for checking string simlarity".
2 - "String simlarity can be measured by many algoriths".
3 - "Machine learning include many algorithms for string simalrity".
4 - "Cosine simlarity is one of the algorithm used for string simlarity".

Result are :
